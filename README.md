# HideAndSeek
The original minigame, free, and better than ever !     

Do you know the hide and seek? It's a game where some people (the hiders) hide themselfs and then the other people (the seekers) go seek them and have to find them in a limited time.  
This is a recreation of this game for pocketmine !  
Please note that this is still under development.
